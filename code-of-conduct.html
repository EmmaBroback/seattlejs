            <h1>The SeattleJS Code of Conduct</h1>

            <h2 id="the-quick-version">The Quick Version</h2>
            <p>SeattleJS is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment for all our particpants. We will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior, remarks, images, or online posts. We will not tolerate harassment in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup without a refund at the discretion of the meetup organizers.</p>
            <p>All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at SeattleJS are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

            <h2 id="need-help-">Need Help?</h2>

            <p>If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or to report anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, please contact one of our
              <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/members/?op=leaders">organizers</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="the-less-quick-version">The Less Quick Version</h2>

            <p>Everyone - including attendees, sponsors, speakers, and organizers - is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior or harassment of any kind is not tolerated.</p>
            <p>Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant. This inculdes in our community online, at all related events, and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.</p>
            <p>SeattleJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup for all attendees, regardless of gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, physical appearance, or body size. Harassment includes: prejudicial verbal or written comments, sexual imagery in public spaces or inappropriate use of nudity (including in presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
            <p>Sponsors and speakers should not use sexualized or inappropriate images, activities, or other material in their advertisements or talks. Booth staff, including volunteers, should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes or otherwise create a sexualized environment. We reserve the right to review all materials and remove them from distribution if they are determined to be inappropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, anything that would make someone think &quot;Hmmm, that&#39;s inappropriate&quot; may also be unacceptable behavior.</p>
            <p>Any participant asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately. We expect all participants to follow these rules at meetup and workshop venues, as well as meetup-related social events.</p>

            <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>

            <p>If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup organizers immediately. Meetup organizers introduce the talks, and you can find their contact information on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/members/?op=leaders">Meetup</a>.</p>
            <p>If you canâ€™t find a staff member, <a href="http://twitter.com/seattlejs">SeattleJS on twitter</a> is always there for you.</p>

            <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>

            <p>If a participant is asked to stop harassing or inappropriate behavior, they are expected to do so immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate; this may inculde warning the participant, immediate expulsion from the meetup with no refund, and/or banning from any future SeattleJS meetups or associated events.</p>
            <p>Our foremost concern is the safety and comfort of all our particpants. We will evaluate any possible sanctions with regard to whether or not they provide the safety needed.</p>
