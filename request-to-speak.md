# Speaking at SeattleJS

We believe that anyone who writes code for a living is capable of giving an awesome talk at SeattleJS. Our community is ultimately about pulling together a passionate group of web developers, facilitating learning and building relationships. Sometimes the best talks are from well-known speakers who manage popular open source projects. Sometimes they are from developers who have solved a gnarly problem and want to share their solution. 

There are many kinds of great talks, but they all focus on **WHY** a developer should adopt a technology or process rather than simply WHAT it is.
