# Sponsoring SeattleJS

SeattleJS could not exist without the support of the community, and this includes companies who understand the importance of investing in the local developer community. Improving the quality of the developer community in and around Seattle means that better products and services are built here and hopefully more companies choose to stay here.

## How You Can Help

SeattleJS meets anywhere from once to twice a month. Our events are free (or near free) and we rely on sponsors to help pay for things like the venue, food and drink. $1500 is a good ballpark, depending on venue and attendance.

## Submitting a Sponsorship Request

We use Github issues to manage requests to sponsor. Just click on the issues icon on the sidebar to get started:
